# autonomous-barcode-sorting-ur10e
This project demonstrates an AI-powered robotic arm system using the UR10e manipulator and Robotiq 3F Gripper for automated object sorting based on barcode detection. The system utilizes Webots simulation, OpenCV, and Pyzbar to detect barcodes, grasp objects, and place them in predefined locations.
